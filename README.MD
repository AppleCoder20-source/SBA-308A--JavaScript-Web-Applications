# SBA JS Web App

In this SBA we were tasked to fetch data from an API using either fetch or axios.

## Description
In this SBA, I made a Joke Web App from Joke API,  in which users were able to retrieve 10 sets of cards each time from clicking the Get Cards Button. Whenever user clicks the button, it will continously generate  a new set of 10  cards each time  with jokes.
